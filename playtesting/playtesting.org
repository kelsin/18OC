    Initial capital is definitely too high. Cutting it in half. I also felt
    restricted on the map so going to remove the prebuilt Y tiles except for
    Huntington beach which will become a lollypop for the next game.

    Changing pars to 60, 100, 220 and 340 with PE, SP and ATSF starting at 160,
    180 and 200 respectively.

    Also goin to try all green city tiles being 3 sided and all brown being 4
    sided. This removes the need for K labels on the map.

    Everyone gets two track actions for plain tiles or one for city tiles.

    No other changes until I play again.

    Initial capital was better. Company financing was better, but trains were
    shit. If I want the game to only have four companies, need to heavily change
    the roster.

    Don't want to change issueing rules yet until I play with better trains.

    Track was ... ok. I like the two yellows, but it still felt a little slow?
    Maybe just awkward. Not changing it for now. I think I like the 3 sided
    greens.

    Trains finally worked and I got to the merger stuff... problem is it's
    broken. Company cycling just happens constantly and companies never get
    enough to afford the next trains. When you reopen companies you don't get
    enough capital to do anything.

    The auto runs for the merging companies is odd and choosing which to sell
    into is also odd. The merger into SPSF doesn't seem impactful. D trains are
    too much in the beginning and the token game isn't playing out how I would
    like.

    Ideas?
    * Two yellows or one upgrade is probably best to help with 2 train runs
    * Issueing like 46 in order to buy trains with the initial issues
    * 1817 like M&A round where companies without trains get acquired and others
      may be sold in optionally.
    * More companies? Make PE a player owned company? All player owned?
    * No minor or 20% shares, complicates things for no benefit I think. It's
      cute having the DRR be a minor but I don't think the cute is worth
      it. With only 4 player companies, having one be crippled by being a
      partial cap minor is just odd.
    * If I keep the two NPCompanies around, it might not be worth the whole
      weird merger thing, doesn't do enough.

    I wasn't good about keeping the queue of companies in order... need to work
    on that.
