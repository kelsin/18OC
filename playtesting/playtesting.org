    Initial capital is definitely too high. Cutting it in half. I also felt
    restricted on the map so going to remove the prebuilt Y tiles except for
    Huntington beach which will become a lollypop for the next game.

    Changing pars to 60, 100, 220 and 340 with PE, SP and ATSF starting at 160,
    180 and 200 respectively.

    No other changes until I play again.
