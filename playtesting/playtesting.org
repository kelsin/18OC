    Initial capital is definitely too high. Cutting it in half. I also felt
    restricted on the map so going to remove the prebuilt Y tiles except for
    Huntington beach which will become a lollypop for the next game.

    Changing pars to 60, 100, 220 and 340 with PE, SP and ATSF starting at 160,
    180 and 200 respectively.

    Also goin to try all green city tiles being 3 sided and all brown being 4
    sided. This removes the need for K labels on the map.

    Everyone gets two track actions for plain tiles or one for city tiles.

    No other changes until I play again.
